## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS(EventListener)



### What I learned

I tackled a lot the elements' positionning while doing this task. Some solutions were new and even surprising for me. Especially, how to make an element with an absolute position stay centered while the screen width is changing.

```css
.woman-img {
  height: 50%;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  top: -29%;
}

```
Also for the first time I've used the overflow concept to affect the visibility of images (before I've known only about z-index).



### Continued development

I haven't still found a solution of how to make the box image remain at place(this is the body's child), while the screen width is changing, hence I definitely must grapple with it.
